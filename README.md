# Project: Games Catalogue

The main goal is making a game catalogue using Typescript with Node.js, Express, Axios, Sequelize, React & Tailwind gathering the games data from igdb api. (To run locally you need your own twitch keys)

## Structure

The project is divided in two folders, "client" and "server", as the name suggest "client" folder has everything related to the browser-side. Also "server" folder has everything related to the API. Check every folder README for further instructions.
